# Reflection on learning outcomes

This page is to illustrate why I believe the learning outcomes should be sufficient for me.

## Professional Duties

My portfolio serves as proof that my products are all according to the activities prescribed in the learning outcome.&#x20;

I have also provided with several end products and products that aid further development. The final product is the wrestling game, with some others being the initial prototype, the [product-design-document.md](../design-phase-wrestling-game/product-design-document.md "mention"), [product-concept-document.md](../design-phase-wrestling-game/product-concept-document.md "mention").&#x20;

These products all fit within the User Interaction area, specifically game design.

### Highlight

I want to specifically highlight [creating-new-concepts.md](../design-phase-wrestling-game/creating-new-concepts.md "mention")and [implementing-the-story-flow.md](../implementation-phase-wrestling-game/implementing-the-story-flow.md "mention") as I think these illustrate why I believe this should be a sufficient

## Situation Oriented

The company thought my contributions were valuable, both the initial prototype and the wrestling game.

My work was structured, following what was noted in [project-plan.md](../analysis-phase/project-plan.md "mention")and adapted to work with how TweeKracht does things.

### Highlight

I want to specifically highlight [implementation-would-you-rather.md](../implementation-phase-improved-prototype/implementation-would-you-rather.md "mention")Out of all activities I created for the initial prototype, the company was the most excited about this one.

## Future Oriented Organisation

Both in the [project-plan.md](../analysis-phase/project-plan.md "mention") and in the [an-introduction-to-the-project.md](../introduction/an-introduction-to-the-project.md "mention"), I have identified the stakeholders in this assignment and described the context.

I also decided to continue working on the initial prototype in order to ensure a release product would come out at the end of this internship.

## Investigative Problem Solving

The first few weeks of my internship was spent identifying the problems with the app, and doing this via involving the user with tests.&#x20;

Then, before immediately creating solutions to these problems, I set a set of design principles to serve as guidelines.

I have used several different methods to answer the questions and approach any challenges in this portfolio

## Personal Leadership

This internship I really had to take the reins of my own project. Sometimes I needed a bit of a push in the right direction, but after that it felt like I was pushed down a hill and I'd take that new direction and keep going with it.

This feedback partially came from weekly meetings with my assessor, which I always took to heart and worked on every time.

### Highlight

I want to specifically highlight [creating-new-concepts.md](../design-phase-wrestling-game/creating-new-concepts.md "mention")as a way of taking feedback.&#x20;

## Targeted Interaction

Every week I had a meeting with the people at TweeKracht where I communicated what I would do that week and what I had been struggling with
