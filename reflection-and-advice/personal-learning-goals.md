# Personal learning goals

At the beginning of my internship, I set the following goals I wanted to achieve:

## Clean coding following a design pattern

I was not really able to do this, due to me working on an existing project for \~half the internship. However, I was able to work within the codebase that was already existing. During the part where I worked on my own game, I was in a continuous time crunch and used an external tool to handle most of the game flow, only writing a few functions.

## Taking the reins of my project

I am really mixed about this, I felt like I was constantly balancing the wants and needs of Mieke and Arien as well as what I needed to do to graduate as well as things I wanted to do.&#x20;

However, as the internship continued, I think I really found my footing and managed to do this. Even if it's too little too late, I am happy with the latter half of how the internship went

## Writing clear, concise research

I personally think this is the best research I've written, being able to write research with a clear purpose and result. I don't think any of the documents have gone on for too long.
