# How did the internship go?

I am equally happy and disappointed with how the internship went, I am happy with how I managed to pull around and provide something in such a short time that was still able to provide the players with a fun experience.

However, I have found my communication to be lackluster, which made a lot of the internship a lot harder.

Two big examples of this happening are at the beginning of the internship, when I did not properly communicate that part of the assignment was also finding out what was wrong with the current prototype. This only became clear to my assessors 5 weeks into the assignment. This is because I believed I made this clear, but looking back at how I handled this, I see now that I could have made a better effort.

The second occurrence was when I told my first assessor that my initial prototype was focused on onboarding, which is something she clearly did not know. Once again, looking back, I see how I did not make this clear earlier, never explicitly stating it.

I also am proud of how much I persevered, even if it wasn't always easy.

I also am glad how I handled communication, even if there were issues of miscommunication, with weekly meetings consistently with my assessor, only missing one due to having a surgery and therefore not making progress. These sessions were critical, sometimes harsh, but very valuable to me.

I wish I communicated more clearly and explicitly, this is something I made great progress on, but only too late.&#x20;
