"2023/10/11 2:22:52 p.m. CET","1","Michael: The app gave me white noise after filling in half of the game. When filling in the soft or hard side, whenever either of the halfs are completed and the video stopped playing, the app turns to white noise. I could still interact with the app, but I couldn't see the results at all.","Yes","Text","","","","4","What I do in my daily life","I don't know what this applies to.","The question ""How often did you have to really think about your answers?"" should be a 1-5 scale, not a 1-10."

"2023/10/11 3:05:44 p.m. CET","5","Ã–mer","No","","First of all, I don't know what the game means by ""energy"". At times, both of the presented options felt correct. The results for ""soft side"" or ""hard side"" can be confusing as well, for example one result I got for ""soft side"" was ""It just makes sense"".","No","The first video section gives vague information about the gist of the game, as well as taking too much time. They could be replaced with fewer videos and more text. The questions asked during the game can be replaced with more specific words instead of only ""What gives you energy?"" which is confusing.","4","What the options mean;What I do in my daily life","Not really.","I think replacing the stock images in the menu backgrounds would improve the aesthetic of the game."
