# Portfolio flow

The portfolio will go over each phase of the project and show what I've done during that phase. Most pages will follow a simple flow of answering 5 questions:

## Questions

### Q1: What is the problem?

I will use this question to describe what the problem is and briefly why this is a problem. This is to give the reader a clear insight as to why I do the things I do

### Q2: How did I solve this?

This will describe how I solved the problem, for most code this is very brief as this is unimportant and very boring. For more vague concepts (such as concept and design) I will go into more detail as this is important for the reader.

### Q3: What is the result?

For tangible results, I will usually be linking to the stepping stone (see below). Sometimes I will describe the result (especially for small/somewhat intangible results.)

### Q4:  How did I validate this result?

This is to show the reader that it's not just me who thought the result was good. For things like designs and research, this means I also presented it to the stakeholders.

### Q5: What is the next step?

Now that I have a validated result, there's the next step. This question will answer what that next step is.

### Stepping stones

This is where I link all documents created for this specific step.

## Conclusion

In the end, I will properly and concisely answer all research questions, as well as list every outcome for the semester and demonstrate why I meet their requirement&#x20;
