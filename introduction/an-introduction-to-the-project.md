# An introduction to the project

### About TweeKracht

TweeKracht is a company that for 10 years now has developed personality-based games. Among these are products like the Kernkrachten game, The Grow The Flow Game, and The Energy Game.

TweeKracht was founded by Ariën Kingma and Mieke Boogert, and they have trained several coaches over the years.

TweeKracht has been developing its own games to analyze a person’s character, behavior and to find the strengths of a person for a while now. The goal of the games is to grow the resistance, autonomy, and connection with themselves and others and to find directions to grow.

They use their games for both individual people and in business contexts. The games are used for career development, and stress coaching but also preventing bore- and burnout. They are also used for team building, team forming, and training in businesses.

The goal of the game is for players to find their core strengths, so they can focus on these strengths and feel their energy go up. These core strengths also connect to their other games.

From the beginning, their focus has been on physical games because these help create a personal connection with the player. The physical games have a larger impact, and the overall experience of the game is more immersive.

Now they want to explore digital products to make the games more accessible for people who don’t have access to coaches or trainers. There already are a few prototypes and MVPs made of different games through the years. The overall experience of the games is slowly improving and they’re slowly coming to a point where they have a finished product to release.

### The assignment

The goal of the project is to take the digital prototype and investigate why the effect isn’t present yet in the digital game but IS present in the physical game. The desired effect is that the player is immersed in the game to such a degree that the player plays the game with their feeling and not their mind, and gets a more accurate result.

From previous observations, as well as previous interns working on this project TweeKracht has indicated that the results from the digital prototype aren’t accurate and that players are just randomly clicking answers due to low engagement. Since focusing on your results should bring you more energy, using these inaccurate results for further lessons and focusing on them will decrease the player’s energy.&#x20;

These inaccurate results are not present in the physical game. When playing the physical game, I observed people not only being shocked at how accurate their results were but also how engaged they were in the game. This is not present in the digital prototype.

The results of this research will be used to improve the current prototype in Unity.

TweeKracht indicates that the biggest problem with the current prototype is that players are playing impatiently and just clicking answers. The current version of the application uses videos to explain the rules and display results, but players have indicated that this is too boring.

I will rapidly iterate on a variety of concepts to see what improves user engagement and accuracy. This will mean that at the end of the internship, I will not only have an improved prototype, but also a variety of concepts that didn’t make it in the final build.

The assignment is about getting to know the userbase and analyzing how to trigger the desired reaction while keeping the game engaging, as well as validating a specific feature with a focus group who hasn’t tested the previous product, so I will focus on that, going in-depth on user experience and testing.
