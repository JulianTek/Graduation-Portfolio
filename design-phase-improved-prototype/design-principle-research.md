# Design principle research

## What is the challenge?

I can't just make things that I think would improve the game, but I need a set of guidelines to adhere to when creating improvements

## How did I solve this?

### Literature study (Library)

I looked at a variety of studies about game development design principles.&#x20;

Motivation seems to be an important factor in creating a fun game experience, with motivation defined as the combination of "the desire to be competent" and "the inherent enjoyment of the activity"

Laine & Lindberg, 2020 has also created a list of over 50 design principles. I've picked the ones to adhere to by checking the following guidelines:

* Does the design principle address one of the issues mentioned in the Introduction chapter?
* Can an implementation of the design principle fit within the current prototype?
* Can the impact of a design principle be tested?

Using these guidelines, I have selected the following design principles:

<table><thead><tr><th>Design principle</th><th width="203">Description</th><th>Reason for choosing</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Raise curiosity by interesting and unpredictable challenges</td><td>Provide challenges to pique a player's interest</td><td>Challenging players to think about subjects they have trouble with</td></tr><tr><td>Freedom of choice and control in gameplay</td><td>Provide players with different choices in playing the game</td><td>Provide players with choices in how to play the game</td></tr><tr><td>Create clear, meaningful, and achievable goals</td><td>Inform your player of the end-goal</td><td>Avoid confusion by informing the player</td></tr><tr><td>Provide time to reflect amid intense game moments</td><td>Properly pace the game</td><td>Give players the ability to think about their answers</td></tr><tr><td>Provide the status of the game process and next available actions</td><td>Provide an overview of the game status</td><td>Let the player know what is about to happen to prevent surprises and negative reactions</td></tr><tr><td>Relate to familiar activities</td><td>Relate activities in the game to activities familiar to the player</td><td>Avoid confusion in the player</td></tr><tr><td>Relate to past activities</td><td>Relate activities in the game to activities familiar to the player</td><td>Avoid confusion in the player</td></tr></tbody></table>

## What is the result?

All this research has been documented here, including full validation

## How did I validate this result?

### Available product analysis (Library)

For each design principle chosen, I've searched for games with the intent of teaching something that adheres to that specific design principle.

This is to prove that these design principles are used both within regular games as well as games with teaching elements.

The games picked are all available on Steam, except Duolingo. However, these are all games that have a teaching element. Whether that be playing guitar or CPU Architecture.

I decided to use a wider variety of games instead of just psychological games/tests because I want my implementations to not just be stuck to what other psychological games use, therefore I want to validate these design principles against a variety of games.

## What is the next step?

The next step is to create a variety of implementations on how to use these design principles.

The design principles named will be used to test if the implementations hold water and can actually improve the existing prototype
