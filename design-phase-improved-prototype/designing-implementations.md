# Designing implementations

## What is the challenge?

Now that I have a set of design principles to adhere to as guidelines, I want to create some implementations that will change the game's biggest issues

## How did I solve this?

### <mark style="background-color:blue;">Brainstorm (Workshop)</mark>

I have created a variety of concepts for the biggest issues.

As a reminder, these are:

* The goal of the game is unclear
* People have issues differentiating between soft and hard
* People have issues with thinking about the ideal world

### <mark style="background-color:blue;">Co-Creation (Workshop)</mark>

Mieke and Arien also helped me with creating concepts, during weekly meetings as well as during  "regular hours" when I was creating concepts.

## What is the result?

With these and my design principles as my guidelines, the following concepts were created

### The ideal world

These are all things that should make the player think about the ideal world more

#### Would you rather

Have players pick the preferred statement out of two to create an ideal world

#### Picking words

Have the player pick from a list of floating words. These are all adjectives that can be used to describe one's ideal world.&#x20;

#### "What would you do" quiz

This is separate from the other parts and can be implemented and used no matter which of the previous ideas are implemented.&#x20;

Now that the player is thinking about their ideal world, ask them questions about their daily life in this ideal world. Don't have this be like the other products from TweeKracht, which asks something similar, but have the player answer in concrete activities

### Hard and soft

#### "Have you ever felt" quiz

The game asks the player if they've ever felt specific emotions, or if they've ever done a specific thing in their life, and when answering yes, display something that lets them know if a specific emotion/action is hard or soft

### Explaining the game

#### Think of something nice

The current digital prototype, as well as the physical game, tasks the player with thinking of something nice to feel their energy rise. This currently just tasks the player with thinking about it, but adding interactivity (Having them write it down) will have them think about it more

## How did I validate this result?

### Pitch (Showroom)

I have presented all of these to Mieke and Arien, they suggested I add more than "just text" and think outside the box more.

However, due to the shift of directions into a new implementation, this is something to take into account if another person works on this prototype.

### What is the next step?

The next step is to implement these changes which will then be tested against the target demographic again
