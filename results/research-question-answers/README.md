  How can I redesign the Energy Game to increase player engagement, make the
  game of the goal clear, and make sure players can more easily imagine the
  ideal world and their hard/soft side?

# Research question answers

## Main question answer

Initially I tried to stick to the existing prototype; improving what already stands to ensure a great release product.

I did this by introducing minigames to the application, as well as a bit of explanatory text. This implementation really focused on the onboarding of the game, as the tests proved that the game itself didn't have many problems (aside from an abundance of videos)

These minigames were created from design principles I established early on and validated using Available Product Analysis, making sure all minigames adhered to these so that they could all provide improvements and also be tested.&#x20;

However, after testing this new prototype, I found that the game would have to be overthrown and a new game would have to be made to increase player engagement.

By creating a scenario and having the game set in this scenario, I translated the choices from the Energy Game into choices someone in this world would have to make. This not only makes the ideal world and hard/soft aspects of the energy game easier to cope with, with them being almost entirely removed.
