# Sub question 1 answer

### Why is the goal of the game not clear?

When usability testing the prototype, it became obvious that the goal of the game was not clear. People were confused about what to do or what the end goal was.

People also didn't know what energy was. This was not disclosed anywhere in the app.

People also felt that sometimes both of the options were correct (Which they can be, just depending on your hard or soft side)

### How can it be improved?

The first iteration tackled this by simply adding a page where the goal was explained. By creating a set of design principles to adhere to, I made sure this works both within the prototype that was there and also create a definite improvement. \


In the Wrestling game prototype, the goal of the game was changed from making the choices to find out what gives you energy, to guiding your player character to be the best wrestler that there is.&#x20;

This personification guides people to make the choices they would naturally.
