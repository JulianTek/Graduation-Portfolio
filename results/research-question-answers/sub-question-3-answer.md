# Sub question 3 answer

## Why do people have a hard time thinking about their hard and soft side?

The hard and soft side that the game uses are something personal, with some objective measure. Hard energy is a bit more outward, with soft energy being more emotional and inward.

The biggest issue players had with this is that they were just confused about what these concepts meant.

There is one side game that is supposed to help players connect with their hard and soft side, but players thought this was confusing, too. As there is no explanation to this, and just pops up with a big "HOW DOES IT FEEL FOR YOU?" text at the top of the screen.

## How can I have people think about this more easily?

In the initial prototype, I created [implementation-hard-soft-quiz.md](../../implementation-phase-improved-prototype/implementation-hard-soft-quiz.md "mention"). Using the design principles I set, I created a minigame that has people think about what hard and soft emotions are, and having players relate to emotions they are familiar with

However, because hard and soft emotions are experienced differently by everyone, so there is no way to "objectively" measure hard and soft emotions, this minigame wasn't of much help.

In the wrestling game, the player plays the game twice. Once as a "face" (good guy) and once as a "heel" (bad guy) (for more information, [the wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Face\_\(professional\_wrestling\)) provides good info) where heels are usually cunning, outward, trying to do anything to get crowds to hate them, whereas faces are generally trying to be nice people, even to other heels, trying to get the crowd behind them by putting the heels in their place.

This reflects hard and soft, with soft being the babyface and hard being the cunning heel.
