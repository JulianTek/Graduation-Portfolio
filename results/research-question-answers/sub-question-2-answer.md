# Sub question 2 answer

## Why do people have a hard time thinking about their ideal world?

This is something that came up during testing. The ideal world is different to everyone, but it should serve the same goal: Making people imagine not having to deal with roadblocks that prevent them from picking the option they want to pick.&#x20;

A lot of people had never thought about their ideal world prior to this, or thought that it was so unachievable that it wasn't worth talking about. Some even thought that because the goal of the game was unclear, they had issues with thinking about the ideal world, while others weren't aware of the relevance of the ideal world.

## How can I have people think about it more easily?

In the initial prototype, I created the [implementation-would-you-rather.md](../../implementation-phase-improved-prototype/implementation-would-you-rather.md "mention")and [implementation-ideal-world-creator.md](../../implementation-phase-improved-prototype/implementation-ideal-world-creator.md "mention"). I used the design principles I created in [design-principle-research.md](../../design-phase-improved-prototype/design-principle-research.md "mention") to make sure the implementations actually would be an improvement.

In the wrestling game, the ideal world is not needed, as players will take on the role required of them, even if none was assigned. Players will usually reflect their own values on their in game characters.

Because the choices are now translated into a different setting, the need for the player to be in their ideal world is not necessary anymore
