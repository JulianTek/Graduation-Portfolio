# Advice

## Advice on the initial prototype

Ideally, if this application is going to be pursued, you only have to polish the game and make sure everything works and have to make no new additions.

The gains from my additions were noticeable, so there is definitely some merit in continuing this application if TweeKracht wants a release product.

### Would You Rather

Would You Rather was said to improve engagement the most, if you are to continue on the initial prototype, definitely **do not** cut this.&#x20;

Much like with most of the initial prototype, the game needs to feel more "alive." This means adding some animations, and lively backgrounds. The explanation for the minigame should be spiced up, too.

### Ideal World Creator

This concept can be used, but I did not notice an increase of player engagement nor an even bigger increase in understanding the ideal world compared to Would You Rather.

However, should you continue this, the next step would be to make it so the words actually float independetly of one another, instead of moving at the same intervals.

Additionally, you want to add some feedback for when the player clicks on the words. There should also be a way for the player to know the words they chose throughout the game, not just towards the end,

### Hard/Soft quiz

There should be a replacement for this minigame, as I misunderstood this part of the game. Ideally, it should play similarly to the side game that was already present.&#x20;

### Tutorials/Explanation

These should be spruced up and made livelier, too.

Ideally, you should find a way to explain the game without bombarding the player with text. Videos should be avoided, too, as people didn't like seeing these.

## Wrestling game

This game will likely not be continued, since this is just an experiment to see if translating the Energy Game is feasible. However, here are some key insights:

### Passion for personification

People were passionate about personification. Especially the inner demons. This is something that can be split off into its own game, having you actually fight your inner demons.

### Find your passion

If you're recreating a game like this, find something you're passionate about the theme the game around. That will improve the product.

I am a big fan of professional wrestling, I know a lot about the industry and general fan reception of certain characters. Having this knowledge helped me translate the choices easier, even if I had to explain what certain things are.

That said, the game should be kept accessible to someone who is not familiar with your theming, which is why I got creative with some of the scenes (In professional wrestling, match winners are already pre-determined, so having to prove yourself to gain a world title shot, as one of the scenes in the game depicts would literally never happen unless this agreement is filmed for [kayfabe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayfabe) reasons)

#### Don't ignore the game rules

However, you also want to design the game around the rules of The Energy Game. Part of why I picked the wrestling theme is because it would work really well with hard/soft, as these can be interchanged with heel/face dynamics.
