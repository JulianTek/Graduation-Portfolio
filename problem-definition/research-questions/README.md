# Research questions

For the assignment, I have set up the following research questions. Answering the sub questions will contribute to an answer to the main question

## Research strategy

For answering the questions, I will use the DOT-Framework. This makes use of the following domains

* <mark style="color:green;">Library</mark>: Research what already has been found out and what guidelines already exist
* <mark style="color:blue;">Field</mark>: Know your users, their needs, wishes and limitations within the context that they will use your product in
* <mark style="color:purple;">Lab</mark>: Test parts or concepts of your product, or the final product
* <mark style="color:orange;">Showroom</mark>: Test your ideas in relations to existing work
* <mark style="background-color:blue;">Workshop</mark>: Prototype, design, and co-create to get insights into how things might work

These domains have several methods. For example, library contains things like expert interview and literature analysis, while Field contains things like document analysis and surveys. All methods can be found [here](https://ictresearchmethods.nl/Main\_Page) and [here](https://cmdmethods.nl)

## Main question/Design challenge

Design a solution for vocational education students to more easily think about the ideal world, think about their hard and soft sides, and more clearly understand the goal of the game to retain engagement in the energy game

## Sub questions

> What are the current challenges faced by students when using the existing digital prototype?

> Why are students currently not engaged enough in the current version?

> Why do the players have issues with getting into the ideal world?

> How can the game keep players engaged?
