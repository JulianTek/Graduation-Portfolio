# Midterm feedback

## Feedback

I got the following feedback from my midterm presentation

* Show don't tell. Use pictures to provide important context for the sake of showing what the game is
  * This was something I already was going to do in the final presentation and portfolio, but now I realize this would be too late and I should have done it in the midterm presentation.
* I should set clear guidelines for the final test
  * This is already in my head, but very cluttered so, therefore, I should write this down in a document
* I need to work more methodically, with using the DOT-Framework
  * This is something I definitely should pick up, and will continue to do until the end of the internship
* Communicate if release ready is doable as well as define what exactly it means
  * Again, this is something I knew and was in my head, just not written down
* Think outside the box more: Be more creative with the medium

## Other ideas

During the session, some suggestions were brought up that a GPT bot could be used as a substitute for the coach. This is something that I will look at through the [intermediate-test.md](../implementation-phase-improved-prototype/intermediate-test.md "mention")
