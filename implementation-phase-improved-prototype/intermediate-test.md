# Intermediate test

## What is the challenge?

I want to know if people are still missing the feedback that a coach brings in the physical game.&#x20;

## How did I solve this?

### <mark style="color:purple;">Think-aloud testing (Lab)</mark>

I let 6 people within the target demographic play the new demo with my implementations, the first part of which was done without any instructions from me, like how students will eventually play the game on release.

Some players had played the previous prototype, others had not, this was&#x20;

During this, players were encouraged to make comments about the game

### <mark style="color:purple;">A/B Testing (Lab)</mark>

The second part of the test involved me playing the physical game with the players. I did this to also let them experience what the physical game is like.

I had previous experience playing the energy game as a coach during the talent market, where I played with a handful of people.

The Energy Game is different from other card games, in the sense that there's no cards that get "played."&#x20;

The cards are for the coach's eyes only, and the player only sees the back of them. The player is tasked with answering the questions the coach asks.

There is also no winner, nor are there any right answers. The end goal of the Energy Game is for the player to find what gives them energy. The player has to look within themselves and give the answer they think is most accurate for themselves.

The physical game gives coaches so-called "intervention cards." These contain methods that a coach can employ if a player has issues picking.&#x20;

The intervention cards are for the coach's eyes only. They don't get "played" in a sense, but serve as reminders that these methods exist to aid the player.

I used these during this section of the test, even to control a player's answers, and afterward would ask players if they thought this was helpful.

There are 11 interventions, all to be used under different circumstances, I decided to use the following

* "Goal or means:" Ask the player if they do x to achieve y, or if they do y to achieve x. The intended goal is the option that should be picked.\
  For example: "Are you curious to be playful, or are you playful to be curious?"\
  This intervention is usually employed when a player says they do both of the offered choices. Whether the player gets energy from these options is usually not important for this intervention.
* "Reverse it:" Instead of asking the player which of the two options gives them more energy, ask them which gives them less energy. This often brings a lot of clarity to the player.\
  This intervention is usually employed when the player thinks both of the provided options give them energy.
* "Take it away": Ask the player if they would like it if I took one of the options away and take care of that. If so, then the option I didn't take away should be their answer.\
  This intervention is used to validate that the player didn't just randomly pick an answer or to test if the answer they picked is one they can stay behind, even if the other is taken away.
* "Just Repeat:" I would repeat all the previous choices made by the player. When a player hears their choices again, they can better feel the text and content.\
  This intervention is always used when playing the physical game. Simply going "In the ideal world, where you're acting through your soft side, you are being social, in a way that's warm and cozy, do you do x or y?" counts as employing this intervention

I chose these because they had to do with when a player makes decisions or to validate the answers the player gave, the others did not and helped in other areas, or were not applicable for The Energy Game.&#x20;

What follows is two rounds of the physical game, one where the player did understand the choices, another where the player did not.

#### Round 1 example

Question: "In the ideal world, in your hard side, you are being active, do you work on going forward and personal growth or do you create things and make them happen?"

Answer: "I do like creating things, so I create and make it happen."

Intervention: "So if I take away personal growth, you wouldn't mind at all? How do you feel about this?"

Answer: "Yeah, it still feels good for me."

This turned out to be the right choice as the player could find themselves in the final conclusion

#### Round 2 example

Question: "In the ideal world, in your hard side, are you more active or are you more social?"

Answer: "I don't really know, it's confusing"

Intervention: "The goal of the game is to find what gives you energy. So, this choice should be the one that gives you more energy. If you can't choose between those two, which gives you the least energy?"

Answer: "Well, being social is kind of draining."

This lead to me picking active for this player's hard side

### <mark style="color:green;">Interview</mark>

Afterward, I held a short interview with the player. Depending on their experience, I'd ask different follow-up questions

## What is the result?

### Goal of the game

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (35).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

There were still some people who had issues with understanding the goal of the game, but compared to the previous \~50%, we are now down to 33% of people who didn't understand the goal of the game

This is because there is still a lot of text in the tutorial, which causes people to lose interest.&#x20;

This coincides with the same number of people who thought feedback would be helpful. Everyone that understood the goal of the game had no issues picking their answers.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (45).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Overall, people who had no issues with making choices did not need the feedback a coach provided. The opposite is also true, people that HAD issues making choices had issues making choices

### Ideal world

People did not have as many issues thinking about their ideal world during the game, there were also positive reactions to the game itself.&#x20;

### Hard/Soft

This is where I found people still needed the most explanation. This is because hard and soft aren't in stone and everyone experiences these things differently.

This is also something a pitfall of [implementation-hard-soft-quiz.md](implementation-hard-soft-quiz.md "mention"), as these all have definitions of hard and soft that are not malleable.



## Conclusion

Overall, the clarity of the game improved but there is still a lot of work to be done. This goes for the other 2 issues, too. A first step in the right direction, but a lot of improvements can still be made
