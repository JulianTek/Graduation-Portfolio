# Previous prototype

Below is a video of the previous prototype that I will be improving

Me and other interns at TweeKracht went over this prototype and gave the following feedback:

ENERGY GAME:

* Very easy to just "click through" the menus without thinking about it. It's hard for the game to give you feedback for this
* The goal of the side game ("HOW DOES IT MAKE YOU FEEL?") is unclear, and there is no explanation on this
* Overlapping cards can cause issues
* The '?' icon on the card is unclear. You can reasonably assume it's about help, but one might expect some more explanation on what the card does by clicking on it rather than advance the game
* Because the game is mainly focused on the centre of the screen, the "undo" and "settings" buttons are hard to notice
* The videos help with imagination
* Having pictures on the cards could already help with what the card means
* No option to skip the videos (This is not for end-user, just a slight note for developers)
* No help when a choice is unclear or you don't know what to do
* Having to swipe the results screen is unclear
* The results now are very generic (for example: the video that plays says "if you're playful, find other people who are playful" instead of personalizing this to your result)

This, combined with what I will find from users from testing will be the basis of what I will do during this internship.
