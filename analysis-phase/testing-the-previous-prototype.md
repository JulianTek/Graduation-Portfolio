# Testing the previous prototype

## What is the challenge?

What are the current challenges faced by students when using the existing digital prototype?

## How did I solve this?

At first, a test plan was set up, this contains all relevant things like how long the test takes, the audience of the testers, and the tasks they're going to perform. You can find this in [test-plan.md](test-plan.md "mention")

In short, I conducted the test as follows:

* I had a group of between 5 and 10 students complete a test
* They played the previous prototype Sava (the previous intern) made and using think-aloud testing I noted their comments
* After the testers were done, I had them fill out a survey
* Me and the testers went over the survey results together in order to get more than just quantitative information, or have the participants elaborate on answers I was confused by

This was done several times. I chose to do a group of 5-10 students so that I could assist when needed while still keeping an eye on things

## What is the result?

See [test-result.md](test-result.md "mention")

This has resulted in a change of research questions. These are as follows

### New main question

How can I redesign the Energy Game to increase player engagement, make the game of the goal clear, and make sure players can more easily imagine the ideal world and their hard/soft side?

### New sub-question 1

Why is the goal of the game not clear to players and how can this be improved?

### New sub-question 2

Why do people have a hard time thinking about their ideal world and how can I have people think about this more easily?

### New sub-question 3

Why do people have a hard time thinking about their hard and soft side and how can I have people think about this more easily?

## How did I validate this result?

I have shown these results to Mieke and AriÃ«n, and together, we came to the following conclusions:

* Results are more accurate than expected
* The biggest issue is that players don't know what the goal of the game is
* The players have issues with thinking about the ideal world

These are the issues I will be focussing on from now on

## What is the next step?

The next step is to take each point and follow their process for an implementation&#x20;
