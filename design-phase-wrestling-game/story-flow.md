# Story flow

What is the problem?

For this game to achieve its goal of "making decisions the means, not the end" I will have to translate the choices from the energy game into something that fits the narrative

## How did I solve this?

### <mark style="background-color:blue;">Decomposition (Workshop)</mark>

The way I tackled this was by at first writing a generic wrestling story, and slowly introducing more elements from the Energy Game.

* The first iteration was a generic "Rags to riches" wrestling story, I wanted to keep this element in, so that every player would be a winner after they kept their result. Other than that, I kept in an element of internal struggle, fighting with your inner demons.
* The second iteration introduces the element of choice. But none of the placement nor the choices themselves were from the Energy Game. I kept in one choice throughout the other iterations: A choice on whether the player wants to start as a solo star or join a tag team.
* The third iteration put the choices in their approximate location, and writing the story around that.&#x20;
* The fourth iteration was the final story that I will be following. Including a translated version of all the choices

Using the book that accompanies a coach during the energy game, I managed to learn a lot about the results, both the hard and soft results, as well as the eventual results. These helped me translate a few of the choices. Specifically, the ones you make at the end of the game

## What is the result?

Below is a diagram of the story flow. The choices here are translated into how they will work in the story. The document linked below has how the full story will play out

## How did I validate this result?

### <mark style="color:orange;">Pitch (Showroom)</mark>

To make sure these choices are translated properly and the story is engaging, me and Mieke looked at the story together.&#x20;

I had to revise a few times, specifically the choices.

At first, I didn't know a choice for every choice, specifically the ones that pertained to the social options.&#x20;

The 2 bottom-right choices came after this pitch. This was also when I was given the ok to work on the story.

## What is the next step?

The next step is to implement this story into a Unity Game
