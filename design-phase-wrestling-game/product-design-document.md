# Product: Design document

This is the design document that stemmed from the [product-concept-document.md](product-concept-document.md "mention"). This document goes more into detail and should give anyone not familiar with the game. This also includes the fact that it's a translation from The Energy Game, but does not feature any of the choice translations. How I translated the Energy Game choices into choices usable in the game can be found in [story-flow.md](story-flow.md "mention")
