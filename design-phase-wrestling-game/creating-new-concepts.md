# Creating new concepts

## What is the problem?

From the [intermediate-test.md](../implementation-phase-improved-prototype/intermediate-test.md "mention") I found that, while the improvements I made were a step in the right direction, but this step in the right direction didn't do enough to retain engagement and make the game fun. I therefore am overthrowing the game and making a whole new game. The challenge is to create new concepts that will fit this new game.

I am shifting to a whole new game in order to find out whether shifting making choices from the main goal of the game to a gameplay mechanic in order to achieve something else. While this might not result in a release-ready app, it could prove good insight in what can be changed for new projects.

## How did I solve this?

### <mark style="background-color:blue;">Brainstorm (Workshop)</mark>

Initially, I had trouble separating any concept from the core gameplay, so I turned to a game design expert at Fontys.

I had a short meeting where I explained the concept of the game; finding what makes you unique and where you can go through a series of questions. Dissecting the game, we found the following concepts in the game:

* Making choices, this is what drives the game forward, and serves as the main goal of the existing prototype.
* Introspection/self-reflection, this is what is expected the player should do during the game and afterwards

I then wanted to look at how other games tackle these mechanics, so I could then make a framework on how to implement them in my game

With this stripped back explanation of the game mechanics, we took a look at games that use similar mechanics. We found the following:

* Morrowind is the third game in the Elder Scrolls series, a series of roleplaying games. In this game, the player can answer a set of questions to pick their class, the player can also pick equipment that will shape their character more and more around how they prefer to play\

*   Disco Elysium has a unique system of forming your character around you. The game features lots of dialogue and even more choices the player can make, some of them are politically charged in nature.\
    If you make enough comments in one political direction, your "inner psyche" will tell you about "yourself."\
    This gives the player a moment to reflect on if this is really what they want to be.\

* Reigns is a game where choices are the gameplay, much like in the Energy game. However, every choice in this game has an immediate effect and sometimes are even provided with immediate feedback sometimes. There is also an overarching story in this game which you play through with the choices, whereas in the Energy Game you play the game to make the choices\

We decided that a story or scenario was necessary to make the game more engaging, and turn the choices implicit, so that the player makes choices to progress this story.\


This is what came out of the brainstorm. Our main question for this was "How can we turn the choices in gameplay from explicit to implicit?"

## What is the result?

What mainly came out of the brainstorm is the following:

* The current game needs to shift choices from the main goal of the game to a mechanic that furthers something else.
* The most common way to do this is via a story
* There needs to be feedback from making choices that's feasible, instead of just "play a video about your choice."

With these insights, I created 3 new concepts

1. A virtual pet, where the choices on how you raise them are translated from the Energy Game. Your slime will eventually shape into one of the archetypes from the Energy Game\
   ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (54).png>)&#x20;
2. A professional wrestling story, where the player plays a rags to riches story and has to make important decisions about their career. These choices are once again translated from The Energy Game\

3. A detective game, where you make choices to solve a murder, with the choices also translated from the Energy Game

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (56).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

I chose to go with the professional wrestling concept. I did this based on the following criteria (<mark style="background-color:blue;">Multi-criteria decision-making</mark>):

1. What game has the best way of converting choices from the end to the means?
2. What game can best provide the result to you?
3. What game best works in the playtime? (Between 10/20 minutes)
4. What game best translates the hard/soft side of The Energy Game?

Both the wrestling game and the virtual pet game translate the Energy Game choices well. The detective game as described has 2 stories, the story of the murder, and the story of _you._ The stories can't be intertwined properly.&#x20;

Professional wrestling is, in essence, theater. This makes it easier to write a story specifically based on the choices one would make in The Energy Game.

Both the virtual pet game and the wrestling game also have the best way of providing the result to you. As your little pet or the wrestler you play change depending on the choices you make.  I want the result to not just be a screen at the end, but something that the entire game leads up to. As there's a bigger story at play during the detective game, the results would just lead to a screen at the end.

The only game that would not be best with the playtime is the virtual pet game, as these are best enjoyed indefinitely (or at least, until the player gets bored of it)

Translating the hard/soft side of The Energy Game is difficult in most of these concepts. However, the easiest concept to do this in is the wrestling game. In professional wrestling, there's always a "good guy" and a "bad guy".  These can easily be modified to be "hard" and "soft."

## How did I validate this result?

### <mark style="color:orange;">Pitch (Showroom)</mark>

I presented my concepts and choices to Mieke and Arien. They were very enthusiastic about the professional wrestling concept and virtual pet. They did tell me that I had to properly translate the choices for the professional wrestling concept, to not lose the goal of the game.

### <mark style="color:orange;">Peer review (Showroom)</mark>

The concepts were also shown to people within the target demographic, who were most enthusiastic about the virtual pet concept and confused about the others. Some people in this demographic had played the game before, others haven't. The ones who had played the energy game before were mostly confused by the other concepts, until I explained to them that I would translate the choices.

## What is the next step?

The next steps are to create concept and design documents for this new wrestling concept.
