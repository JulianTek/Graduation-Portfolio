# Reading guide

## Introduction

This is my graduation internship project for TweeKracht. During my time here, I redesigned their digital prototype of The Energy Game to improve player engagement.

The Energy Game is a game in which players will have to find out what gives them more energy. This game is played in two rounds, each having a set of identical questions, and by choosing what fits you best, you get two results that combine to fit an archetype.

The distinction in these rounds is the mindset in which the player plays. One round is played through the perspective of their hard side, and one through their soft side. The hard side is the more rational and outgoing, and your soft side is the more emotional and caring side. The player is tasked with getting in this specific mindset when playing a round.

All the player has to do is choose between the options presented. During physical play, there is also a coach present who will help guide the player if they can't choose, and to make sure the choices fit the player.

The game is played in a person's ideal world. They have to think about what this means to them, this is to prevent players from picking options they normally would due to real world obstacles.

Over previous semesters, a digital version of this game has come to fruition. However, when testing the most recent iteration, TweeKracht found that the engagement of the players still wasn't where they wanted it to be, nor were the players as immersed in the game as when people play the physical game.

Part of the assignment is therefore also figuring out why the app is currently not engaging players. This will be done via testing early, I will also do tests to not only validate but also to involve the user closely in the development process.&#x20;

The app is to be distributed in schools for mobile devices. The teacher will provide the students with an access code that will provide the students access.

## Design Challenge

Through testing the existing prototype, the main points that were causing people to not be engaged were confusion with the main goal of the game, the ideal world and one's hard and soft side.&#x20;

Design a solution for vocational education students to more easily think about the ideal world, think about their hard and soft sides, and more clearly understand the goal of the game to retain engagement in the energy game

## Project phases

> Disclaimer: There are two products I created. One is a follow up on the already existing app, one is a new concept. I will mention both in this portfolio, even if I only worked on one of them at a time

### Analysis Phase

During this time, I spent most of my time finding out what the issues with the current prototype were. I did this by testing the prototype. During this time, I also made my project plan.

#### Sub questions tackled

* What are the current challenges faced by students when using the existing digital prototype?
* Why are students currently not engaged enough in the current version?

#### Methods used

<mark style="color:purple;">Usability Testing (Lab)</mark>

Conducting testing on the previous prototype to figure out where the issues lie

<mark style="color:blue;">Problem Analysis (Field)</mark>

Going through the prototype and finding where improvements could be made

#### Deliverables

[previous-prototype.md](analysis-phase/previous-prototype.md "mention")

[project-plan.md](analysis-phase/project-plan.md "mention")

[test-plan.md](analysis-phase/test-plan.md "mention")

[test-result.md](analysis-phase/test-result.md "mention")

#### Result

The biggest problems with the game are that the players do not understand the main goal of the game, they also have issues thinking about the ideal world in which the game is supposed to take place and the hard and soft sides.

### Design phase

During this phase, I designed solutions that should help with the pain points described in [test-result.md](analysis-phase/test-result.md "mention")

#### Questions tackled

> Note: I shifted to new research questions after the test, these can be found in [testing-the-previous-prototype.md](analysis-phase/testing-the-previous-prototype.md "mention")

* Why is the goal of the game not clear to players and how can this be improved?
* Why do people have a hard time thinking about their ideal world and how can I have people think about this more easily?
* Why do people have a hard time thinking about their hard and soft side and how can I have people think about this more easily?

#### Methods used

<mark style="color:green;">Literature Study (Library)</mark>

I used several studies to set up design principles to follow during the creation of the new implementations

<mark style="background-color:blue;">Co-Creation (Workshop)</mark>

Together with TweeKracht, we designed a flow of the game featuring new elements that are all meant to tackle the issues

<mark style="color:green;">Available Product Analysis (Library)</mark>

When creating the wrestling games, examples of several games were used that have decision-making as a gameplay mechanic and how they use this.

<mark style="background-color:blue;">Brainstorm (Workshop)</mark>

Both implementations I made make use of brainstorming to create new concepts.

<mark style="background-color:blue;">Multi-Criteria Decision making (Workshop)</mark>

When creating the wrestling game, I used multi-criteria decision-making to choose what concept I was going to pursue.

#### Deliverables

[designing-implementations.md](design-phase-improved-prototype/designing-implementations.md "mention")

[product-design-document.md](design-phase-wrestling-game/product-design-document.md "mention")

[story-flow.md](design-phase-wrestling-game/story-flow.md "mention")

#### Results

There are guidelines in place for the implementations, as well as concepts for new implementations.

The wrestling game also has a concept chosen and a story flow designed for it.

### Implementation phase

During this phase, I coded and tested new implementations that should help with the pain points

#### Questions tackled

* Why is the goal of the game not clear to players and how can this be improved?
* Why do people have a hard time thinking about their ideal world and how can I have people think about this more easily?
* Why do people have a hard time thinking about their hard and soft side and how can I have people think about this more easily?

#### Methods used

<mark style="color:blue;">Document Analysis (Field)</mark>

I used my design principles to create implementations, I also used the documentation on The Energy Game to properly translate a wrestling story into The Energy Game

<mark style="color:green;">Expert Interview (Library)</mark>

I had an interview with Mieke about hard and soft emotions when I was unable to figure out examples of hard emotions for myself

<mark style="background-color:blue;">Brainstorm (Workshop)</mark>

I realized the concepts for implementations as fully fledged implementations, with designs/sketches to accompany them.

<mark style="background-color:blue;">Prototyping (Workshop)</mark>

I created implementations based on the designs

For the wrestling game, I created a prototype of what a game that utilizes personification looks like.

<mark style="background-color:blue;">Requirement Prioritization (Workshop)</mark>

When creating the wrestling game, due to limited time, I had to prioritize requirements to create a satisfactory product.

<mark style="color:purple;">A/B Testing (Lab)</mark>

When testing the first implementation (The extension of the existing prototype) I used A/B testing, with the physical game also present, to test if feedback was missing from the app or if my implementations were sufficient to make up for the lack of feedback from a coach.

<mark style="color:purple;">Think-aloud testing (Lab)</mark>

I also used think-aloud testing to test the first implementation

### Deliverables

[implementing-the-story-flow.md](implementation-phase-wrestling-game/implementing-the-story-flow.md "mention")

#### Results

There are now two implementations, one is an extension of the existing prototype.

There is also a different game that utilizes personification in order to change the elements of the ideal world and hard/soft and translates those into a fun activity.
